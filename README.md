This simple demo app is here to show a solution that weâ€™re using in [Fancy Pixel](http://fancypixel.it) 
for the JSON generation and that can be a quick and easy alternative to most commonly used systems 
like [Jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) or [ActiveModel::Serializers](https://github.com/rails-api/active_model_serializers).
